	///     A special single bucket aggregation that enables aggregating on parent docs from nested documents. Effectively this aggregation can break out of the nested block structure and link to other nested structures or the root document, which allows nesting other aggregations that aren’t part of
	///     the nested object in a nested aggregation. The reverse_nested aggregation must be defined inside a nested aggregation. Options: path - Which defines to what nested object field should be joined back. The default is empty, which means that it joins back to the root / main document level.
	///     The path cannot contain a reference to a nested object field that falls outside the nested aggregation’s nested structure a reverse_nested is in.
