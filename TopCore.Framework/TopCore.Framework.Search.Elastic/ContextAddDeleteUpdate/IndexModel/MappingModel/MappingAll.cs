    ///     The idea of the _all field is that it includes the text of one or more other fields
    ///     within the document indexed. It can come very handy especially for search requests, where
    ///     we want to execute a search query against the content of a document, without knowing
    ///     which fields to search on. This comes at the expense of CPU cycles and index size. The
    ///     _all fields can be completely disabled. Explicit field mappings and object mappings can
    ///     be excluded / included in the _all field. By default, it is enabled and all fields are
    ///     included in it for ease of use. When disabling the _all field, it is a good practice to
    ///     set index.query.default_field to a different value (for example, if you have a main
    ///     "message" field in your data, set it to message). One of the nice features of the _all
    ///     field is that it takes into account specific fields boost levels. Meaning that if a title
    ///     field is boosted more than content, the title (part) in the _all field will mean more
    ///     than the content (part) in the _all field. "_all" : {"enabled" : true}
