    /// <summary>
    ///   This attribute is used if you need to change the structure of the nested objects in Elastissearch to nested nested objects. Nested fields may
    ///   contain other nested fields. The include_in_parent object refers to the direct parent of the field, while the include_in_root parameter
    ///   refers only to the topmost “root” object or document. Nested docs will automatically use the root doc _all field only. Internally, nested
    ///   objects are indexed as additional documents, but, since they can be guaranteed to be indexed within the same "block", it allows for extremely
    ///   fast joining with parent docs. Those internal nested documents are automatically masked away when doing operations against the index (like
    ///   searching with a match_all query), and they bubble out when using the nested query. Because nested docs are always masked to the parent doc,
    ///   the nested docs can never be accessed outside the scope of the nested query. For example stored fields can be enabled on fields inside nested
    ///   objects, but there is no way of retrieving them, since stored fields are fetched outside of the nested query scope. The _source field is
    ///   always associated with the parent document and because of that field values via the source can be fetched for nested object.
